## Coding: Class and Object

Create a new Java project and implement the following steps to practice inheritance and classes in Java.

-   Step 1: Create a base class "Vehicle" with properties like "Manufacturer", "Model", and "Year of Manufacture".
-   Step 2: Create a derived class "Car" that inherits from "Vehicle" and has additional properties like "Number of Doors".
-   Step 3: Implement a method in the "Vehicle" class that outputs information about the vehicle.
-   Step 4: Override the method from step 3 in the "Car" class to also output the number of doors.
-   Step 5: Create instances of the "Vehicle" and "Car" classes and call the methods to output the information.

Wow, you are fast! If you like, also work on this voluntary bonus task.

-   Create another derived class from "Vehicle" called "Motorcycle". Add appropriate properties to this class.
-   Implement a method in the "Motorcycle" class that returns the type of motorcycle (e.g. Chopper, Sportbike, Cruiser).
-   Create instances of both "Car" and "Motorcycle" and call the methods to output the information.
-   Discuss together how inheritance was applied in this scenario and what advantages it offers.
